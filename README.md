## Description  
#### The Triangle Tracker enables one to determine the type of a triangle by using the values of the sides of a triangle.  
## Instructions  
* Enter the values of the three sides of the triangle
* If an equilateral triangle, all the values entered will be the same so it will alert that it is an equilateral triangle

* If it is an isosceles triangle, only two values will be the same therefore it will alert that it is an isosceles triangle

* If it is a scalene triangle, the sum of two values will be greater than the third value therefore it will alert that it is a scalene triangle.Note that in this case none of the values are equal

* If it is not a triangle, the sum of two values will be less or equal to the third value therefore it will alert that the values entered are not of a triangle.

| **Behavior** What the program handles | **Input** | **Output** |   
| Determine if all the values are equal . | 1,1,1     | Equilateral       |  
| Determine if two sides are equal .  | 1, 2, 2 | Isosceles  |   
| Sum of two sides is >  third side | 3,4,5 | Scalene Triangle  |  
| Sum of two sides is <= third side | 1,2,3 | Not a triangle |
