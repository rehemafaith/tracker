## Description  
#### The Triangle Tracker enables one to determine the type of a triangle by using the values of the sides of a triangle.  
## Instructions  
* Enter the values of the three sides of the triangle
* If an equilateral triangle, all the values entered will be the same so it will alert that it is an equilateral triangle

* If it is an isosceles triangle, only two values will be the same therefore it will alert that it is an isosceles triangle

* If it is a scalene triangle, the sum of two values will be greater than the third value therefore it will alert that it is a scalene triangle.Note that in this case none of the values are equal

* If it is not a triangle, the sum of two values will be less or equal to the third value therefore it will alert that the values entered are not of a triangle.
